# Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: Is Klick'r free?**
A: Yes, Klick'r is free and open-source (GPL-3.0).

**Q: Do I need Root access?**
A: No. Klick'r uses the Android Accessibility Service, which works on non-rooted devices (Android 7.0+).

**Q: Will this get me banned in games?**
A: Use at your own risk. Klick'r injects gestures like a human, but some games have sophisticated detection (e.g., checking for installed accessibility apps). We are not responsible for banned accounts.

### Technical

**Q: Why does it stop working after a while?**
A: Your phone's battery optimization might be killing the service.
-   **Fix**: Go to Settings -> Apps -> Klick'r -> Battery -> Set to "Unrestricted" or "Don't Optimize".

**Q: The service refuses to turn on!**
A: This is an Android bug.
-   **Fix**: Restart your phone. It usually resets the Accessibility Service handlers.

**Q: Image detection is failing on my new phone.**
A: Check the screen resolution. Templates are resolution-dependent. You may need to recapture your templates.
