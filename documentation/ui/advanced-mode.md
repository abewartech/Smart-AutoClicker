# Advanced Mode (Smart Mode)

Advanced Mode is the core feature of Klick'r. It requires configuration but offers unlimited flexibility.

## The Editor UI

When you edit a Smart Scenario, you see two tabs:
1.  **Conditions**: Where you define the images to look for.
2.  **Events**: Where you define the logic (If Condition -> Then Action).

## The Overlay

When you run a Smart Scenario, a floating menu appears:
-   **Play/Pause**: Starts/Stops the detection loop.
-   **Debug Eye**: Toggles the visual debug overlay (shows detection boxes).
-   **Record**: (If available) Allows recording simple click sequences.
