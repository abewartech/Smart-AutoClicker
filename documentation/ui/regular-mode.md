# Regular Mode (Dumb Mode)

Regular Mode is for simple, repetitive tasks that don't require "seeing" the screen. It is perfect for cookie clicker games or keeping a screen active.

## Capabilities

### Multiple Click Points
-   Add multiple targets (1, 2, 3...).
-   They click in order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1...

### Configuration
For each point, you can set:
-   **Click Interval**: How fast to click (e.g., 50ms).
-   **Swipe Duration**: Turn a click into a swipe.
-   **Randomization**: Add jitter to the position (X/Y) or interval to avoid detection.
