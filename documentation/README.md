# Smart AutoClicker (Klick'r) Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Klick'r, an open-source Android automation tool designed for both casual users and developers.

## What is Klick'r?
Klick'r is an advanced auto-clicker application that goes beyond simple repetition. It uses image detection to interact with the screen dynamically, allowing you to build complex automation flows that react to what is actually happening on your device.

## Core Concepts
- **Image Detection**: The app can "see" buttons or images on your screen and click them.
- **Automation Flows**: A sequence of actions (clicks, swipes, waits) triggered by conditions.
- **Privacy First**: All processing happens on your device. No data is sent to the cloud.

## Who is this for?
- **Gamers**: Automate repetitive tasks in games (grinding, farming).
- **Power Users**: Automate UI interactions in apps.
- **Developers**: Contribute to an open-source Kotlin project using Clean Architecture.
